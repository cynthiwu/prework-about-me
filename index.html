      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey there! My name is Cynthia and I am a Technical Recruiter who is looking to recrtuit herself.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, but have been living in Seattle for the last 8 years. I'm pretty sure I can call myself a Seattleite...</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobby is spending time with my loving fiance and our cute cat, Kaya. I also love tackling creative projects, some I finish and some I don't.I guess "tackling" might be the wrong word here.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would die for a job that allows me to be more creative and hands on.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a funky little neighborhood in Seattle called Fremont.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I think it would be a role that would combine my innate abilities and developed passions. Who wouldn't want that?</p>
